 A player has started a new turn, per the Complete Turn use case (\ref{completeturn})
\subsubsection{Main Flow} 
The use case begins when the system updates the local player's board to reflect the opponent's last move (S-10).

\subsection{Flow of Events for the Validate Move Use Case}
\label{valmove}
\subsubsection{Preconditions}
The active player has selected a piece to move, and a destination square for the piece per subflows S-30 and S-40 of the Complete Turn use case (\ref{completeturn}).
\subsubsection{Main Flow} 
The use case begins when the system determines what type of piece the player has selected (S-10).  The system verifies that the proposed move is valid according to chess rules that govern movement for the selected piece (S-20, S-30).  The system then updates the board (S-40) and the use case ends when the system transmits the move to the opponent (S-50).

\begin{description}
\item[S-10 Determine Type of Piece] The system checks whether the player has selected a Pawn, Rook, Bishop, Knight, King, or Queen to move (E-10).
\item[S-20 Validate Standard Move] The system runs an algorithm specific to the type of piece selected to determine if the proposed move is valid.  If the proposed move is not verified as a valid standard move the system checks if it is a valid special move (S-30), otherwise the system updates the board (S-40, E-20)
\item[S-30 Validate Special Move] If the selected piece is a Pawn, the system checks if the proposed move is a valid En Passant move.  If the selected piece is a King, the system checks if the proposed move is a valid Castling move.  If the move is determined to be valid, the system updates the board (S-40, E-20, E-30)
\item[S-40 Update Board]  If the move was determined to be valid then the system shall update the board for the local player so that it stores the move that the player just made.
\item[S-50 Transmit Move] The system shall transmit the details of the move to the opponent in a specified transmission format (E-40), and allow the opponent to make a move per the Complete Turn use case (\ref{completeturn}).
\end{description}
\subsubsection{Alternative Flows}

\item[E-20 Allied King Under Check] if the player's King was under check at the beginning of the turn, the system checks if the King is still in check.  If this is the case, the system displays a dialog box stating that the player cannot finish the turn with the King in check, and the player must select another move via the Select Piece subflow of the Complete Turn use case  (\ref{completeturn}).  If the allied King is no longer in check, the system updates the board (S-40).
\item[E-30 Proposed Move is Invalid] If the proposed move proves not to be valid, the system displays a dialog box stating that the move is invalid and the player must select another move via the Select Piece subflow of the Complete Turn use case   (\ref{completeturn}). 
\item[E-40 Connection Lost] If the system cannot transmit data to the remote player because the connection is no longer active, the game terminates and the system shall allow the player to create a new game per the Start Game use case (\ref{startgame}). 
\end{description}

\subsection{Flow of Events for the Complete Turn Use Case}
\label{completeturn}

It is either the first move of the game, or a transmission of the opponent's last move has just been received per the Complete Turn use case  (\ref{completeturn}). 
\subsubsection{Main Flow}
  This use case begins when it is the local player's turn to move. The system shall update the board and inform the player if there are special circumstances(S-10).  Unless the player is in check-mate, the player shall select an allied piece within the board and a destination square (S-20, S-30).  The use case ends when the move is validated and carried out (S-40).
\subsubsection{Subflows}
