\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}
This Software Requirements Specifcation provides a complete description of all the software design requirements and specifcations of AnonChess, a chess game. This document explains all features, functions, and constraints of this program.
AnonChess is a program built to allow remote users to play each other in chess through an anonymous system. Its main focus is just to let people play; as users log into the system they are paired with the first available player and can proceed. The program needs to be intuitive, reliable, and easy to use.
  
\subsection{Scope}
This document describes the design and architecture of AnonChess. This documentâ€™s intended audience includes everyone working on (designing, developing, testing) AnonChess.
